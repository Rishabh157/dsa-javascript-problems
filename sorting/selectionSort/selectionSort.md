# Selection Sort

imagine you have a bunch of toys (numbers) scattered around your room, and you want to put them in order from smallest to biggest. Selection is like this game

- first of all you have to consider the first index element is the smallest element in the list 
- then you have to check this element to all next array element.
- once you find the less then element of the mininum element that you consider the minimum. then we swap the position both of them
