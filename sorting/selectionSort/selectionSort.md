# Selection Sort Algorithm

Imagine you have a bunch of toys (numbers) scattered around your room, and you want to put them in order from smallest to biggest. Selection is like this game

## How It Works

1. Find the minimum value in the list.
2. Swap it with the value in the current position.
3. Repeat this process for all the remaining elements.

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) due to the two nested loops.

## Implementation

You can find the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in both JavaScript and Python.
